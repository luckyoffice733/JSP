JSP(Java Server Pages)
---------------------

JSP is a server side technology that does all the processing at server. 

It is used for creating dynamic web applications, using java as programming language.

Basically, any html file can be converted to JSP file by just changing the file extension from
“.html” to “.jsp”, it would run just fine.

What differentiates JSP from HTML is the ability to use java code inside HTML. 
In JSP, you can embed Java code in HTML using JSP tags.

LifeCycle Methods of Jsp:
=========================
when you create any jsp internally it will convert into a Servlet with help of Jsp container (jsp-api.jar)

jspInit()
_jspService()
jspDestroy()



Elements of JSP
===============
JSP Declaration
JSP Scriptlet
JSP Expression
JSP Comments


JSP Comments
-------------
Comments are the one when JSP container wants to ignore certain texts and statements.
When we want to hide certain content, then we can add that to the comments section.

Syntax:
-------
<% -- JSP Comments -- %>

This tags are used to comment in JSP and ignored by the JSP container.


JSP Scriptlet
----------------
Scriptlet tag allows to write Java code into JSP file.

JSP container moves statements in _jspservice() method while generating servlet from jsp.

For each request of the client, service method of the JSP gets invoked hence the code inside 
the Scriptlet executes for every request.

A Scriptlet contains java code that is executed every time JSP is invoked.

Syntax of Scriptlet tag:
------------------------
<% java code %>

Here <% %> tags are scriplets tag and within it, we can place java code.

Ex:
---
Create  Dynamic web project named as DemoOnJsp 
Create a jsp file named as index.jsp
write a html code and javacode(scriptlet) to display welcome message.

Note:
-----
Create All Jsp pages under webapp/ or WebContent/


JSP Expression(=)
-----------------
Expression tag evaluates the expression placed in it.

It accesses the data stored in stored application.

It allows create expressions like arithmetic and logical.

It produces scriptless JSP page.

Syntax:
-------
<%= expression %>

Here the expression is the arithmetic or logical expression.

note:
-----
Statements cannot terminate with semicolon.



JSP Declaration
---------------
A declaration tag is a piece of Java code for declaring variables, methods and classes. 

If we declare a variable or method inside declaration tag it means that the declaration is 
made inside the servlet class but outside the service method.

We can declare a static member, an instance variable (can declare a number or string) 
and methods inside the declaration tag.

Syntax of declaration tag:
--------------------------
<%!  Dec var  %>

Here Dec var is the method or a variable inside the declaration tag.

Ex:
===
<%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1"
    pageEncoding="ISO-8859-1"%>
       
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="ISO-8859-1">
<title>Insert title here</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>We are working with JSP </h1>

<%--JSP Comments jsp Scriplet --%>
<%
  out.println("we are working with JSP using Scriplets");
%>
<br>
<%--JSP Expression --%>
sum of two numbers: <%=(50+60)%>

<%--JSP Declaration --%>

<%!
   //defining a variables
   int empId=1001;
   String empName="smith";
   float empSal=4000;
   
   public int additionOfTwoNumber(int x,int y){
	   
	   return x+y;
   }
   
   public void methodOne(){
	   System.out.println("we are in methodOne");
   }
%>

<h1>Employee Details are:</h1>
EMpid :  <%out.println(this.empId);%> <br>
EMpName :  <%out.println(this.empName);%> <br>
EMpSal :  <%out.println(this.empSal);%> <br>

Addition of Two Numbers: <%=this.additionOfTwoNumber(20,30) %>

<%
 this.methodOne();
%>

</body>
